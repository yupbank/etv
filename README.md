# Eye Tracking Visualization toolkit
========================

## why?

Eye tracking device is expensive, luckily recently there are a few projects provide cheap solutions like `the eye tribe(https://theeyetribe.com/)`.

Experiments have being conducted related to things like visualization and human computer interaction, while i am working here in Noah's Ark Lab.

I would like to contribe a few of my auxiliary codes.

So, it's good for things like:

 - heat map
 - visualize both eye location 
 - related parallax visualization
 - caliboration(in progress)


## Thanks to
    
 - the eye tribe
 - the heatmap.js project
 - the parallax.js project
 - the d3.js project
 - tornado
 - redis

----------
if you have questions about my code, i am pleasure to help
